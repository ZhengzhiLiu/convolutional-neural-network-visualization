# convolutional-neural-network-visualization
In this project, I demonstrated how to visualize convolutional neural network (ConvNet) with tensorflow 2.x. Visualizing the intermediates step taking place inside any ConvNet is critical for understanding how it works and improving existing model. This project includes four parts: 
1. visualize activation
2. visualize reconstruction from each layer
3. visualize classes 
4. visualize nueral styler tansfer
