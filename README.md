# convolutional-neural-network-visualization
In this project, I demonstrated how to visualize convolutional neural network (ConvNet) with tensorflow 2.x. Visualizing the intermediate steps taking place inside any ConvNet is critical for understanding how it works and improving existing model. This project includes four parts: 
1. visualize activation
2. visualize reconstruction from each layer
3. visualize classes 
4. visualize nueral styler tansfer
except that Visualizing activation and feature maps which is a forward propagation, visualzing reconstruction from a layer, visualizing classes, and visualizing neural style transfer are a backward propagation utilizing gradient descent. The model used in this project is VGG16, but other models would work similarly.

### visualize activation
